<div style="background-color:black; opacity:0.8;" class="grid-container">

    <div class=" about">  <h2> <code> <b>About</b> </code> </h2> </div>

    <div class="p2" align="center">

        <p>I have used several semantic tags such as &lt;navn &gt; , &lt;footer&gt; &amp; &lt;header&gt;. <br>
            However, I have also used grid container to structure my website &amp; I prefer having this option. <br>
            I have used two main background colors which are dark red &amp; black for they match the background template.<br>
            I tried to combine the different coding solutions that I have learnt so far in every component of this website. <br>
            The design is pretty simple though with few colors and images. <br>
            The most challenging part in this website was the CSS since I have created different class attributes.<br>
            I think that include huge amount of skills and solutions that is difficult master within short time.<br>

    <div class=" about">  <h2> <code> <b>The Website</b> </code> </h2> </div>

    <div class="p2" align="center">
        <p>In order to build this website I have gone through all the learning materials <br>
            that were available on the university platform. The resources included several <br>
            links into tutorial websites that would be beneficial for designing.<br>
            I have made this website independently &amp; it took huge of time, effort &amp; patience. <br>
            I think designing is very creative and fun but time challenging as well.<br>
            I look forward to work with som website designing projects in the future. <br>
            I appreciate this chance <3
